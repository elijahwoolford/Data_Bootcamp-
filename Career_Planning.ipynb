    "For the Harlan talk I was deemed as a data creator and for the radar challenge they believe that I am a programmer. Data science is used as a way of conveying data using various techniques to come to a conclusion. I believe that the first conclusion may not always be correct, or the best way to present that data. Conclusions should always be challenged by data scientists, and we should always work to find the best way to come to the best one. The harlan survey has a lot of techniques that I am unfamiliar with, but I expect to get better at some of the skills listed while going through this course. I agree with the T-shaped approach to a data scientist's skill set. We should be really proficient at a certain skill, but also have some exposure to various other techniques. I think that this will enhance our ability to draw conclusions better from datasets and help us to be a more well rounded scientist. The radar challenge survey says that I understand the value of planning and know that thinking through an analysis is more efficient and less error prone than starting an analysis and seeing what sticks. I agree with this assessment. Although I haven't worked in the field, this analysis is accurate in my current career. As a lab analyst I work daily as a planner and never start an analysis unless I know where it's going. Overall these surveys give me a good idea as to where I am right now and where I should gear my thinking towards. \n",

    "My ideal job would be in the healthcare profession as a data scientist. I would want to specifically work in genetic reasearch and how that affects people who develop cancer. I want to analyze sequences that usually occur with certain types of cancer and see if there's any correlation. Overall, I would help build models that can accuratly predict if someone will develop cancer based off of their DNA profile and family history of any mutations that can develop. Also, for those who already in the early stages of cancer, I would want to be able to use imaging models to directly detect exactly where the cancer is. Radiation treatment is very damamging and used as a localization technique for the cancer. If detection can happen down to the cellular level as well as a treatment method that can identify cancer cells, it would save alot of people from the suffering of radiation. I would find great satifaction if I were able to find a career that appeals to my interests as well as having the ability to help people. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally I would like to work in cancer research with other doctors and data scientists to be able to treat cancer more effciently and prevent it from coming up. I would use computers to analyze DNA and images of cancer to try to see exactly where it is. If we're able to see where exactly the cancer is then the doctors are able to develop effective treatments that aren't as damaging as radiation treatment. I would want to work with multiple types of cancer, finding may different ways of trying to find patterns to make cancer more predictable. Ideally a job in cancer research would be great for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I aspire to use my data science skills to try to help people specifically with cancer. Cancer is an awful disease that takes thousands of lives every month. I want to be a part of the solution that helps build better treaments for patients as well as preventative measures for those who are likely to get it.  \n",
